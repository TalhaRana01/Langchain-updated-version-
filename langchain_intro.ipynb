The basic principles of flight involve four primary forces: lift, weight (gravity), thrust, and drag.\\n\\n1. **Lift**: Lift is the upward force that allows an airplane to rise off the ground. It is generated primarily by the wings, which are designed with an airfoil shape. When the airplane moves forward, air flows over and under the wings. The shape of the wings causes the air pressure to be lower above the wing and higher below it, creating an upward pressure difference. This pressure difference results in lift.\\n\\n2. **Weight**: Weight is the force due to gravity that pulls the airplane downward. For an airplane to ascend, lift must exceed its weight. Conversely, to descend, lift must be less than weight.\\n\\n3. **Thrust**: Thrust is the forward force produced by the airplane's engines. It propels the aircraft through the air, allowing airflow over the wings and thus generating lift. Different types of engines, such as jet engines and propellers, produce thrust in different ways.\\n\\n4. **Drag**: Drag is the resistance force that opposes thrust and slows the airplane down as it moves through the air. It is caused by friction between the airplane's surface and the air, as well as pressure differences around the airplane. Pilots and engineers work to minimize drag through aerodynamic design.\\n\\nThe interaction of these forces allows an airplane to fly. When the engines provide enough thrust to reach a certain speed, and the wings generate sufficient lift to overcome the aircraft's weight, the airplane can ascend. During flight, pilots manipulate the controls to adjust these forces, allowing for climbing, descending, and turning. \\n\\nAdditionally, airplanes have control surfaces (like ailerons, elevators, and rudders) that help maneuver the aircraft by altering airflow around the wings and tail, giving pilots the ability to execute complex maneuvers in three-dimensional space.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 401, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 413, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_29330a9688', 'id': 'chatcmpl-Cs7iSDiqbuvlu6cMPJ0SSJ74C4Eak', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b6a53-6508-7a80-9cef-7b07f4b0bcbd-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 401, 'total_tokens': 413, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n",

       " AIMessage(content=\"Airplanes fly by utilizing the principles of aerodynamics, which involve the interaction between the aircraft and the air around it. Here are the key concepts that explain how airplanes achieve flight:\\n\\n1. **Four Forces of Flight**: Flight is primarily influenced by four forces:\\n   - **Lift**: The upward force that counteracts weight and allows the airplane to rise off the ground. Lift is generated primarily by the wings, which are designed with an airfoil shape (curved on top and flatter on the bottom). As air flows over and under the wings, the difference in air pressure creates lift.\\n   - **Weight**: The downward force due to gravity acting on the airplane’s mass. It must be balanced by lift for an airplane to ascend or maintain altitude.\\n   - **Thrust**: The forward force produced by the airplane’s engines (either jet engines or propellers). Thrust propels the airplane forward and is necessary to generate lift as air flows over the wings.\\n   - **Drag**: The resistance force opposing thrust, caused by friction and turbulence as the airplane moves through the air. Pilots and designers work to minimize drag to improve an airplane's efficiency.\\n\\n2. **Bernoulli's Principle**: This principle explains how the shape of the wing creates lift. As the plane moves forward, air travels faster over the curved upper surface of the wing than the flatter lower surface. According to Bernoulli's principle, faster-moving air creates a lower pressure area above the wing compared to the higher pressure beneath it, resulting in lift.\\n\\n3. **Angle of Attack**: This is the angle between the wing’s chord line (the line from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing) and the oncoming air. Increasing the angle of attack can increase lift, but if it becomes too steep, it can lead to a stall, where lift suddenly decreases and the plane can lose altitude.\\n\\n4. **Control Surfaces**: Airplanes are equipped with various control surfaces that allow pilots to maneuver the aircraft:\\n   - **Ailerons**: Located on the trailing edges of the wings, they control roll and help the airplane turn.\\n   - **Elevators**: Found on the tail, they control pitch (the up or down angle of the nose).\\n   - **Rudder**: Located on the vertical stabilizer (tail), it controls yaw (side-to-side movement).\\n\\n5. **Flight Phases**: \\n   - **Takeoff**: The engines generate thrust, increasing speed until lift is sufficient for the wings to overcome weight.\\n   - **Climb**: The airplane ascends as lift becomes greater than weight.\\n   - **Cruise**: The airplane maintains altitude as lift balances weight and thrust balances drag.\\n   - **Descent and Landing**: Thrust is reduced, and the airplane descends gradually, with lift decreasing until landing.\\n\\nBy managing these forces and using aerodynamic principles, airplanes can achieve stable and controlled flight.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 603, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 615, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_29330a9688', 'id': 'chatcmpl-Cs7ll9UdA7r8sOT4ILR5VMsjwPcND', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b6a56-8403-70f3-9bda-70648e6ce0d5-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 603, 'total_tokens': 615, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}),\n",

Quantum circuits, composed of multiple gates, are used to perform more complex operations.\\n\\n5. **Quantum Algorithms**: Certain algorithms can take advantage of quantum computing capabilities to solve problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. Notable examples include Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases.\\n\\n6. **Applications**: Quantum computing has potential applications in various fields, including cryptography, materials science, pharmaceuticals, optimization problems, artificial intelligence, and more.\\n\\nWhile the field of quantum computing is still in its early stages, research and development are progressing rapidly, and we are beginning to see practical implementations in certain areas. However, building large, reliable quantum computers remains a significant challenge due to issues like decoherence and error rates.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 372, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 384, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_29330a9688', 'id': 'chatcmpl-Cs7ll77QZQ092VaFfSZPzUMcwxasl', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b6a56-8408-7c93-ad5c-2f658340d4c2-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 372, 'total_tokens': 384, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]"
