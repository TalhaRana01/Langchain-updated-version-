       "AIMessage(content='Parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech and other sounds they hear in their environment. This is due to their unique anatomy and behavior. Here are some reasons why parrots talk:\\n\\n1. **Anatomical Adaptations**: Parrots have a syrinx, which is the vocal organ located at the base of the trachea in birds. The syrinx is more complex and flexible than the human vocal cord, allowing for a wider range of sounds and pitches to be produced.\\n2. **Social Bonding**: In the wild, parrots use vocalizations to communicate with each other, including warning calls, contact calls, and courtship displays. By mimicking human speech, they may be attempting to establish a bond with their owners or other birds.\\n3. **Attention Seeking**: Parrots may learn to talk because they associate it with attention and rewards from their owners. When they mimic a word or phrase, they may receive treats, praise, or other forms of affection.\\n4. **Imitation and Learning**: Parrots are highly intelligent birds that can learn through observation and imitation. They may watch their owners talk and learn to mimic the sounds and phrases they hear.\\n5. **Evolutionary Advantage**: In some species of parrots, the ability to mimic human speech may have evolved as a means of communication with humans. This could provide a selective advantage, such as access to food or protection from predators.\\n\\nSome popular parrot species known for their talking abilities include:\\n\\n* African Greys\\n* Amazon parrots\\n* Cockatoos\\n* Macaws\\n* Mynah birds\\n\\nKeep in mind that not all parrots are capable of talking, and even among those that do, the ability to mimic human speech can vary greatly.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 357, 'prompt_tokens': 41, 'total_tokens': 398, 'completion_time': 0.534991873, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.001985402, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.005312892, 'total_time': 0.536977275}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1151d4f23c', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b699f-79b2-7561-bdf9-e152d1e490ec-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 41, 'output_tokens': 357, 'total_tokens': 398})"
